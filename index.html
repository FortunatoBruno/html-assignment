                <h1><strong>About me.</strong></h1>
                <p>One of the things I am most proud of having learned from my mother's teachings is to never give up. She has always encouraged us - me and my two brothers - to never give up, especially when it comes to making our dreams come true. And I say <em>dreams</em> instead of <em>objective</em> because it has a more subjective connotation. This has much more to do with personal fulfillment than with being successful in society, although one does not exclude the other.</p>
                <p>So, I decided to leave my whole life behind in Brazil and come to Canada seeking to fulfill my dream of becoming a web designer and building a future here, and it is not the stones in the long road that will be able to make me give up to do it.</p>
